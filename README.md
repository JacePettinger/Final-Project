# Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-175 Java 2 course at Kirkwood Community College.
## Introduction
In the introductory unit for Java Two during the first few weeks of the semester I have learned new commands and more about how to work with the command prompt.
While I have used the command prompt before in other academic and professional environments, the introductory unit of the class has added to my knowledge base of
how to use the command prompt properly. The introduction to Java during these first few weeks has mostly been a refresher for me, as I have already learned the basics
of Java in a previous course and have a fundamental understanding of coding in general from previous Java and coding classes that I have taken both at Kirkwood Community
College at at previous academic facilities.
## Test Driven Development (TDD)
During the introduction to test driven development I learned that tests can be incorporated into code as it is being written and developed. Creating test classes that are
embedded into the project was an entirely new concept that I had not encountered before. While being a new concept, I find it to be a helpful addition to the knowledge I
already have. I have learned how to test my code more effectively which has thus taught me how to write more structurally secure code that will be more immune to logic
errors.
## Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Lambda Expressions
During the second module of our class I got to learn about the efficiency and readability benefits that lambda
expressions can bring to code through the utilization of functional interfaces. I also learned about the difference
between abstract classes and interfaces, and why generally speaking it is better to implement interfaces than to work
with abstract classes. With this new knowledge from our lessons I now feel capable of creating more compact, easy to
follow code with a stronger design core.
## Open Source Projects
During the open source module of Java Two I learned not only how to make a project open source, but also how to work with others to contribute to the same project. I learned how to use GitHub to fork and clone repositories and how to create a new branch so I am not trying to merge directly into the main branch of a repository. I also learned what merge conflicts are and how to resolve them so that pull requests can be resolved quickly and efficiently.
## Generics
During the Generics module of Java Two I learned how to make singular methods that are capable of handling many different data types. Generics helps offer a simpler and more efficient way to code than overloaded methods. I learned how to read the annotation for generic methods, learned that most of the classes in the Java API are generic classes and methods, and I learned how to use pre-built generic methods such as Supplier and Consumer that have many versatile uses.
## Lambda Expressions
During the Lambda Expressions module of Java Two we expanded on the knowledge that had been previously set up in the second module, abstract classes, interfaces, and lambda expressions. During this module I learned about built in functional interfaces such as Supplier, Predicate, and Consumer. I learned how to write these functional interfaces not only as Lambda expressions but also with method reference annotation. I learned the difference between the old "long" way of writing these functional interfaces and the newer and shorter way of condensing my code into easier to read Lambda expressions.
## Collections
During the collection module of Java Two we explored deeper into the use of arrays, and also learned when to instead use Collection types such as ArrayLists and Sets. We learned about the added flexibility for size and adding or removing elements with ArrayLists, and learned how to make use of key-value pairs with maps. We also discovered the difference between a map and a tree map, namely that a tree map will sort its keys in their natural order.
